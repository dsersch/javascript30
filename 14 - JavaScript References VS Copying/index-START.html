    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = "Dave";
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = "not Dave";
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = "Lux";
    // console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // changes the original array...

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    let team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    let team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    let team4 = [...players];
    console.log(team4);

    // also .from()

    let team5 = Array.from(players);
    console.log(team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    console.log(person);

    // and think we make a copy:

    let captain = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 32});
    console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    let cap2 = {...person, name: "dave", number: 29};
    console.log(person, captain, cap2);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    // poor man's deep clone...

    const dev = {
      name: 'Dave',
      age: 32,
      social: {
        instagram: "dsersch9",
        facebook: "stolen for money..."
      }
    };

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(dev));

    dev2.social.facebook = "ask Zuck...";

    console.log(dev, dev2);
